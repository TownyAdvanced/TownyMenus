# TownyMenus
An easy-to-use and accessible way for players to use Towny commands.

## Requirements
- [Towny](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny) version 0.100.2.0 or newer.
- Paper 1.20.1 or newer.

## About
TownyMenus is a plugin that adds lots of inventory menus that trivializes interfacing with Towny. Instead of having to scour through documentation, commands are just a mouseclick away.

Players can open the main menu using /townymenu or one of its aliases. The menu subcommand of many towny commands can also be used, such as /town menu to directly open the town menu.

The plugin is currently still in beta, so any feedback is welcome! Feel free to stop by our Discord if you have any ideas for the plugin, or if you just want to chat.

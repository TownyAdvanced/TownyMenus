# TownyMenus
An easy-to-use and accessible way for players to use Towny commands.

## Requirements
- [Towny](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny) version 0.101.2.5 or newer.
- Paper 1.20.1 or newer.

## About
TownyMenus is a plugin that adds lots of inventory menus that trivializes interfacing with Towny. Instead of having to scour through documentation, commands are just a mouseclick away.

Players can open the main menu using /townymenu or one of its aliases. The menu subcommand of many towny commands can also be used, such as /town menu to directly open the town menu.
